## Beta Demo

This is a collection of demos showcasing the features of Kresil resilience mechanisms and their integration with Ktor.

## Mechanisms

- 🔁 [Retry](retry/README.md): Repeats failed executions;
- ⛔ [Circuit Breaker](circuitbreaker/README.md): Temporarily blocks possible failures.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The demos will be moved to a separate repository once a stable version of the library is released.
